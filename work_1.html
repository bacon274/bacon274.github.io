            <h2>
                Polysand is novel material made from low density polyethylene (LDPE) and sand.
                <br /> <br />
                LDPE films are one of the most common and problematic waste streams.
                It is used widely for packaging and often cannot be recycled.
                <br /> <br />
                Typically, because of the cost of collecting and processing waste upcycled or recycled
                goods are <i> artisanal </i> and unscalable.
                <br /> <br />
                The addition of sand dramatically
                <b>improves the material properties while dramatically lowering the cost of manufacturing </b>
                compared to making pure plastic products.
                <br /> <br />
                Polysand is made from 75% sand which acts as aggregate bound together by the plastic.
                The material properties have been characterised by the researchers at Imperial
                College London (paper <a href="https://wasteaid.org/research-paper-how-to-recycle-plastic-waste-into-paving-tiles/">here</a>)
                who liken the material to concrete.
                <br /><br />
                Polysand is currently being used to make paving tiles in a WasteAid workshop in Gunjur in the Gambia.

                Different cross sectional geometries with the same baseline dimensions were compared in three categories:
                strength, mass and ease of manufacture. Strength was tested using FEA simulations of the fencepost under loading and the
                maximum stress was recorded. Ease of manufacture was approximated depending on the complexity
                of mould required to produce the shape. An overall score was calculated from these three
                metrics and the best cross section selected.

                that was used to numerically minimise the volume of the beam while satisfying that the bending stress is less than the strength of the material.
